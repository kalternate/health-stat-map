## Getting Started

1. First, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. It should already be installed on the lab machines.

2. Enter the following commands. Note that it make take a while to install all the npm packages the first time you run `npm i`.
```sh
cd health-stat-map
npm i
npm run dev
```

3. You should see something that looks like the following. Use your web browswer to navigate to the specified local HTTP address. You may be able to do this by control-clicking the address in the terminal. It may be different from the example below.
```
> dev
> react-router dev

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

4. Now you should see the home page. Press the blue link in the center to navigate to the map page. Use the left side panel to select a data indicator.
